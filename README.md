# simple-contact-list
This is my first public project and it was created with the purpose of demonstrating some Spring Framework's features, like REST, Security, JPA and Testing.

Before run this application, make sure:
- the local port 80 is free. Alternatively, you can change the server port by editing the application.properties file.
- pass "-Dspring.profiles.active=prod" param to JVM.

As soon as possible, I will publish a Flutter app for better interaction with this application.
