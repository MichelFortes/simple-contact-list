> Simple Contact List Java Rest API


This is my first public project and it was created with the purpose of demonstrating some Spring Framework's features, like REST, Security, JPA and Testing.

Before run this application, make sure:
- the local port 80 is available. Alternatively, you can change the server port by editing the application.properties file.
- pass '-Dspring.profiles.active=prod' param to JVM.

      java -Dspring.profiles.active=prod -jar simple-contact-list.jar

You can find the Flutter client at https://github.com/MichelFortes/simple_contact_list_app
