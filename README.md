# simple-contact-list
This is my first public project and it was created with the purpose of demonstrating some Spring Framework's features, like REST, Security, JPA and Testing.

Before run this application, make sure you're not using local port 80. Alternatively, you can change the server port by editing the application.properties file.

As soon as possible, I will publish an Flutter app for better interaction with this aplication.
